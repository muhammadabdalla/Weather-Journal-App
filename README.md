# Weather-Journal App Project

in this app we get the temperature of the weather and the date and how the user feels in the out put by taking zip code and his feelings as input .
so this server works in port 8080 in local host and i installed cors and express packages first with npm to use them .
it works when the client send to the api the date and zip code then api respond with temperature then the client send  this data with his feelings to the server then the server rseponse with all of that together.
